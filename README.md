# WarframeBot

## Welcome to Warframe Bot!
Warframe Bot is a simple Discord Bot made using Python. Please note it is a purely educational tool for myself.
However, I still believe a small explanation is due in order to give an idea of its scope and capabilities.

## Arcane Search
By using the API provided by Digital Extremes, and assets provided by the Official Warframe Wiki, the bot is able to display Arcanes of varying archetypes:
- Warframe
- Primary
- Secondary
- Melee
- Zaw

When displaying the arcane, it is able to show the important information of the arcane such as:
- Description & Stats
- Drop Location
- Drop Chance
- Rarity

## Void Trader
The bot is capable of telling the user when the Void Trader known as Baro Ki' Teer will appear, as well as the Relay they will appear in next.
If Baro is currently in a Relay, the bot is also capable of handling this exception. The bot will simply tell the user what time they will leave next, and what Relay Baro is currently present at.

## Weapon Search
Similarly to the Arcane Search above, the weapon search is capable of providing a description for the weapon, as well as its appearance.

Please note that this feature is stil a work-in-progress. I hope to release a more feature completed version soon.
